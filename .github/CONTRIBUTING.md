## Principles

We adapt the [DevIQ principles](https://deviq.com/principles/), applied with
judgment rather than dogma.

### Design

- **KISS**: Prefer the simplest solution that solves the problem at hand.
- **YAGNI**: Build for today's requirements, not for ones you expect to
  arrive.
- **DRY**: Give every piece of knowledge a single authoritative definition.
  Extract once duplication is real, not anticipated.

### Structure

- **Separation of Concerns**: Give each part one responsibility and a clear
  boundary.
- **SOLID**: Give each type one reason to change, extend it without modifying
  it, and depend on abstractions rather than implementations.
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Require collaborators openly in signatures
  rather than reaching for global or ambient state.

### Behavior

- **Principle of Least Astonishment**: Make code behave the way a reader
  expects, starting with names that state intent.
- **Fail Fast**: Surface errors immediately and loudly instead of degrading
  silently.
- **Tell, Don't Ask**: Ask a collaborator to do the work rather than querying
  its state and deciding on its behalf.

### Maintenance

- **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code cleaner than you found it.
- **Tolerance for Imperfection**: Accept good-enough code where the cost of
  perfecting it outweighs the benefit.
- **Architectural Agility**: Keep the architecture able to change as
  understanding of the problem grows.

## Architecture

We structure the repository as a monorepo of independently buildable units.

Within a module, we follow
[Vertical Slice Architecture](https://deviq.com/architecture/vertical-slice-architecture/):
draw boundaries by feature rather than technical layer, let each slice
organize its own internals, and, if it exposes anything, do so only through a
narrow public contract. Anything crossing a slice boundary goes through that
contract, never around it; shared code never depends on a slice.

---

## Documentation

We adapt the
[Google documentation guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/) and
keep documentation concise. Say what the code cannot say for itself, and no more.

### Code Documentation

- **Public Code Contracts** (Declaration documentation): Structured
  documentation attached to exported declarations and public members. Defines
  the behavioral contract for callers (what it does, parameters, return values,
  thrown errors, and restrictions). Avoid explaining internal implementation
  mechanics here.
- **Inline Comments** (Implementation context): Targeted comments co-located
  with code inside function or method bodies. Reserve for non-obvious reasoning,
  subtle invariants, bug workarounds, and business constraints. Never restate
  what the code clearly does, and avoid leaving dead or commented-out code.

### Markdown Documentation

#### 1. README files

We follow the
[Standard Readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)
specification for README files.

- **Root README** (`README.md`): High-level project overview, prerequisites,
  quickstart, and workspace structure. Nothing implementation-specific.
- **Module READMEs** (`<module>/README.md`): Everything a developer needs to
  work on a specific module.

Sections:

- **Title**: The name, followed by a description of what it does.
- **Install**: Prerequisites, environment variables, and installation steps.
- **Usage**: Available runtime commands and interaction flows.
- **Development** (Modules only, if applicable): Tech stack, directory tree,
  and code quality.
- **Deployment** (Modules only, if applicable): CI/CD pipelines, deployment
  targets, and hosting details.
- **Contributing**: A link to the contributing guidelines in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **License**: A link to the legal license governing use.

#### 2. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

We follow the
[matklad ARCHITECTURE.md](https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html)
approach. High-level system structure documentation.

- **Bird's Eye View**: High-level system diagram, infrastructure overview, and
  external boundaries.
- **Code Map**: Top-level directory tree, domain boundaries, and
  architectural invariants.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: System-wide patterns and shared mechanics.

#### 3. docs/API.md (if applicable)

We follow the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification.
Technical reference for external network interfaces and HTTP endpoints.
Applies only if the project exposes an HTTP API.

- **Version**: The current API version number, containing subsections for
  servers and available authorizations.
- **[Tags]**: Dedicated sections for each resource category, detailing each
  endpoint with parameters, request body, and responses.
- **Schemas**: Tabular definitions of request objects and response objects.

#### 4. docs/DESIGN.md (if applicable)

We follow the
[Google DESIGN.md](https://github.com/google-labs-code/design.md)
specification. Standards for UI, UX, and visual identity. Applies only if the
project has a UI.

- **Frontmatter**: Machine-readable YAML design tokens.
- **Overview**: Brand summary, core visual style, and key user flow diagrams.
- **Colors**: Color palette definitions.
- **Typography**: Font families and sizing scales.
- **Layout**: Spacing and structural rules.
- **Elevation**: Guidelines for depth and shadows.
- **Shapes**: Rounded corners and geometric styles.
- **Components**: Definitions and diagrams for specific UI elements.
- **Do's and Don'ts**: Best practices for usage.

#### 5. docs/design-docs/ (if applicable)

We follow the
[Design Docs at Google](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/)
approach. One `<slug>.md` per system or change designed, written before
implementation to collect feedback on it. Warranted when three or more of
these hold:

- The right design approach is uncertain.
- Getting the design wrong would be expensive to unwind.
- The design is ambiguous or contentious.
- It touches cross-cutting concerns that would otherwise be skipped.
- High-level documentation of an existing or legacy system is needed.

A design carrying more decisions than one review can settle is split into
sub-problems, each with its own document; a broader document is read for
context, never extended.

Unlike the documentation above, these are not maintained. A document is
updated until every issue cut from it is closed, then left as-is: an archive
of the decision, not a description of the current system. Design that
changes it goes in a new document linking back to it.

- **Context and Scope**: Objective background on the landscape the work
  lands in and what is being built. Facts, not argument.
- **Goals and Non-Goals**: What the system achieves, and what it explicitly
  will not.
- **System Design**: The design itself, overview first and detail after,
  emphasizing the trade-offs made. Diagrams, API sketches, and data storage
  belong here when the design needs them.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other viable designs, and why each was
  rejected.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Security, privacy, observability, and the
  like, including migration and backwards compatibility when the work
  touches an existing system.
