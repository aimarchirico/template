description: Create new hierarchical issues

## When to Use

Use when the user asks to create new issues.

## Execution Steps

1. Identify the details and context of the issues to create. If these details are not already clear from the user's prompt or context, ask the user for clarification.
2. Map and format the identified work strictly following the hierarchy and conventions defined in `CONTRIBUTING.md#issues` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Automatically infer any required logical child issues to completely represent the hierarchy of work. Ensure each issue is assigned its type (`Epic`, `Story`, `Task`, `Bug`, `Subtask`) and priority (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`) in their respective fields based on the definitions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
3. Show the drafted hierarchy and wait for user approval.
4. Generate a temporary `issues.json` file containing an `items` array where every node in the hierarchy matches this recursive JSON schema:

   ```json
   {
     "items": [
       {
         "title": "string",
         "body": "string",
         "type": "string",
         "priority": "string",
         "children": [
           /* nested child objects following the same schema */
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
5. Execute `bash .agents/skills/issues/scripts/create-issues.sh issues.json` (the script automatically deletes the temporary file upon completion).
