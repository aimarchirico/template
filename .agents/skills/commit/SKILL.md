description: Analyze unstaged changes and create logical, atomic git commits

## When to Use

Use when the user explicitly asks to commit unstaged changes, analyze git diffs for committing, or run the commit skill.

## Execution Steps

1. Execute `git status` and `git diff` to analyze all unstaged changes (including untracked files).
2. If there are no changes to commit, notify the user and exit.
3. Group the changes into logical, atomic units and draft a commit message for each group strictly following the rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md#commits`.
4. Present the proposed commit plan, and wait for explicit user approval.
5. For each approved unit, execute `git add` for those specific files followed by `git commit -m` with the approved message.
